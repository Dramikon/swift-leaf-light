# swift-leaf-light
Swift application fr OS X, light and convenient image viewer. 
This is short and light version of it.

Main intention - to create additional, alternative image viewer to let mac users list images in folder.

Do you remember, when you open one image in folder to view it? When you need to open next one, you close image viewer, find next image, ... or you use Finder, which doesn't work perfect as image viewer especially for laptops.

Swift Leaf let you convenient way to open any image and simply continue navigate images in the same folder.
